Hey all,

Here is a little update video on the making of WebOSv3.

Since the previous video we've reached revision 7 of the OS.

I noticed that there weren't any revisions yet in that other video.

That is an indication that a lot has happened since March 8th of 2021.

A visual overhaul for the login screen, the addition of userLogic, allowing you to create multiple user accounts for multiple people,
you name it.

I've also changed a lot of the user interface regarding the Control Panel, mainly the User Settings and Preferences.
