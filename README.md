# ArcOSv3 (was WebOSv3)

The Operating System Environment, or OSE, build in Electron, running under Windows or Linux.

Think of it as the olden days when Windows ran on top of MS-DOS. ArcOS runs on top of Windows or linux in the same way. You start ArcOS from the start menu, and you are off.

ArcOS sports a modern friendly UI. It also uses a universal app system allowing you to easily load your own applications. It has these applications (at the time of releasing WebOSv3 release 15 (`v3r15`):

- Application Manager
  - Allows you to forcefully close applications and view which ones are opened
- Calculator
  - Really just a calculator
- File Explorer
  - with it's various utilities for file and folder management
- Image Viewer
  - a simple image viewer used to open images from the file manager
- Settings
  - A central location for managing your personalized settings of ArcOS
- ArcOS Notepad
  - with it's various utilities for loading and saving notepads
- Open With
  - A program that opens when you click on a file that wasn't recognized in the extension list
- Execute Command
  - Allows you to execute various of different things
- Shut Down ArcOS
  - Just a shutdown menu

ArcOS currently has about 5700 lines of code, making it my most complicated and biggest project ever. It has been in development since February 17th, 2021, and has grown a ton since. Just start ArcOS r3 and compare it to r12 for example, and see the sheer amount of difference.
