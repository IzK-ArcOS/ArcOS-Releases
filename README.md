# ArcOSv3 (was WebOSv3)

The Operating System Environment, or OSE, build in Electron, running under Windows.

Think of it as the olden days when Windows ran on top of MS-DOS. ArcOS runs on top of Windows or linux in the same way. You start ArcOS from the start menu, and you are off.

ArcOS sports a modern friendly UI. It also uses a universal app system allowing you to easily load your own applications. It has these applications (at the time of releasing WebOSv3 release 12 (`v3r12`):

- Application Manager
- Calculator
- File Explorer
- Image Viewer
- Settings
- WebOS Notepad
- Open With
- Execute Command
- Shut Down WebOS
- 

ArcOS currently has about 5700 lines of code, making it my most complicated and biggest project ever. It has been in development since February 17th, 2021, and has grown a ton since. Just start ArcOS r3 and compare it to r12 for example, and see the sheer amount of difference.
